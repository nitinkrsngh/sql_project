- **Categorizing Data** with `CASE WHEN`  
- **Joining Multiple Tables** (`JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)  
- **Grouping & Aggregation** (`GROUP BY`, `SUM()`)  
- **Sorting and Limiting Results** (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)  



📌 Future Enhancements  
- More **complex analytical queries**  
- **Stored procedures and views** for better dataset management  
- Interactive **dashboard integration** using Power BI/Tableau
